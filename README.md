# HER2 Mutation Analysis and Peptide Candidate Generation #
## overview ##
This project focuses on identifying and analyzing key mutations in the HER2 protein, a well-known oncogenic target, and generating peptide candidates for therapeutic development. The workflow includes:

**Data Preprocessing/** : Cleaning and filtering mutation data to focus on the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER2.

**Sequence Analysis/** : Mapping mutations to the HER2 protein sequence and identifying functional regions.

**Peptide Candidate Generation/** : Extracting peptide sequences around mutation sites for further analysis and experimental validation.

This project demonstrates the integration of computational methods with biological insights, aligning with modern approaches in computational drug design.

## Features ##
**Data Preprocessing/** : Filters mutation data to focus on the extracellular domain (residues 1â€“645) of HER2.

**Sequence Mapping/** : Maps mutations to the HER2 protein sequence and validates them against the reference sequence.

**Functional Region Identification/** : Identifies key functional regions (e.g., dimerization domain) and extracts mutations within these regions.

**Peptide Candidate Generation/** : Generates peptide sequences around mutation sites for further analysis.

**Scalable Workflow/** : Designed for automation and scalability, making it suitable for larger datasets.

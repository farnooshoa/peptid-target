# Peptid-Target: High-Affinity Targeting Peptides for HER2

## Overview
This project, `peptid-target`, aims to identify and analyze key mutations in the HER2 protein—a critical oncogenic receptor—and generate high-affinity peptide candidates for therapeutic development. Focusing on the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER2, it integrates computational bioinformatics with biological insights to support modern drug design. The workflow includes:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and filters mutation data to target the HER2 ECD (residues 1–645).
- **Sequence Analysis:** Maps mutations onto the HER2 reference sequence and identifies functional regions.
- **Peptide Candidate Generation:** Extracts peptide sequences surrounding mutation sites for downstream analysis and validation.

This project showcases a scalable, automated approach to computational peptide design, with potential applications in precision oncology.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Filters mutation datasets to isolate ECD-specific mutations (residues 1–645).
- **Sequence Mapping:** Aligns mutations to the HER2 sequence, validated against UniProt’s reference (P04626).
- **Functional Region Identification:** Pinpoints critical regions, like the dimerization domain, and flags relevant mutations.
- **Peptide Candidate Generation:** Produces peptide sequences around mutation sites, adjustable for length and context.
- **Scalable Workflow:** Built for automation and adaptability to large-scale genomic datasets.

## About
`Peptid-Target` focuses on generating high-affinity peptides tailored to the HER2 receptor, a key target in cancer therapy. By leveraging mutation data and sequence analysis, it bridges computational tools and experimental potential, aiming to contribute to targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Future Tasks
To expand the project’s scope and utility, I plan to:
- **Integrate Structural Analysis:** Incorporate HER2 3D structure data (e.g., PDB files) to assess mutation impacts on peptide binding affinity.
- **Enhance Peptide Design:** Implement machine learning models (e.g., ESM-2 or RF predictors) to optimize peptide affinity and specificity.
- **Add Validation Pipeline:** Include in silico binding affinity scoring (e.g., via molecular docking tools like AutoDock) for generated peptides.
- **Support Multi-Receptor Analysis:** Extend the workflow to other receptors (e.g., EGFR) for broader therapeutic applications.
- **Develop Visualization Tools:** Add plotting capabilities (e.g., with Matplotlib or PyMOL) to visualize mutation hotspots and peptide interactions.
- **Automate Data Retrieval:** Fetch mutation data directly from databases like COSMIC or cBioPortal via APIs.
- **Create a User Interface:** Build a CLI or web app to make the tool accessible to non-coders.
